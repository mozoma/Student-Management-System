👨‍💻 One of the best things you can do as a developer is look back at your old code.

A few days ago, I revisited an old project I wrote 10 months ago — a Student Management System in C.

It was simple but lacked persistence — once the program closed, all student data was gone.

🔧 So I upgraded it!

✅ Added file storage using fopen, fwrite, fread
✅ Data is now automatically loaded when the program starts
✅ Changes are saved immediately after each operation
✅ All functions are documented with clear English comments

🆚 Before vs After

Feature	Before	After
Data Persistence	❌ Not supported	✅ Binary file storage added
Load on startup	❌ None	✅ With loadFromFile()
Auto-save changes	❌ Manual	✅ saveToFile() integrated
Code Comments	❌ Minimal	✅ Full English documentation
